IBAL is the IDA Pro Bootrom Analysis Library, which contains a number of useful functions for analyzing embedded ROMs.

The inspiration for this project was Halvar Flake's x86_re_lib.  This attempts to implement that functionality in a processor-agnostic manner.

Some of the problems that this library tackles:
- Indirect (register target) jumping
- Compiler goofiness such as not using typical function instructions
- Identifying functions used by multiple code islands (interrupt handlers and other unique entry points)

I hope that you find it useful.  For bugfixes and additions please hit me on github or freenode (giminy in both places) or on twitter, @ReverseICS.
